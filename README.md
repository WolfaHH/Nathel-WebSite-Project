Mappool website project

The website is programmed with the POO paradigm while using a MVC struture.
- Router file aims to, in function of _GET or _POST routes, load appropriate controller classes.
  

- Model classes aim to load data, from the database's tables or from the O su API.
  

- Controller classes aim to manage and organize data loaded from model, as well as loading views.
  

- Views classes aim to load web integration contained in Nathel/Osu/View/**/elements folder.

Note: The CollectionView class might be an exception as it effectuates controller job.
